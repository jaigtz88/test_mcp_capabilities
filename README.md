# Angular Toast Notifications Demo

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a **dummy/mock implementation** for demonstration purposes only. The `angular-toast-notifications` library does not actually exist. This project serves as a reference implementation for MCP (Model Context Protocol) server development, showing how to analyze, validate, and generate configuration code.

A sample Angular application demonstrating configuration patterns and usage examples for a fictional toast notification library with JSON-based configuration.

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates:
- Configuration patterns for Angular libraries (JSON-based + environment overrides)
- Service injection and usage patterns in standalone components
- Documentation structure for library features
- Code structure that MCP servers can analyze and work with

## Why Dummy Code is Sufficient

Your goal is to demonstrate:
- ✅ **Code analysis** - MCP can read and understand the configuration patterns
- ✅ **Configuration validation** - Check if toast config follows the documented structure
- ✅ **Code generation** - Generate toast usage based on patterns in sample-app
- ✅ **Documentation sync** - Verify code matches documentation

All of this works perfectly with mock code - no working library needed!

## Features (Mock Implementation)

- Toast notification service with multiple types (success, error, warning, info)
- JSON-based configuration with environment-specific overrides
- Custom toast positions and durations
- Progress bar and pause on hover support
- Demo components showing various toast implementations

## Documentation

Refer to the [documentation](./doc/README.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.
